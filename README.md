## Ear Biometrics Using Transfer Learning

This project develops an ear biometric recognition system utilizing transfer learning with multiple deep learning models. We employed pre-trained architectures such as EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG19 to classify ear images with high accuracy.

The models were fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving remarkable results: DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB0 reached 100% accuracy, ResNet50 achieved 99.39%, VGG19 achieved 99.24%, and MobileNetV2 recorded 98.49%. To optimize performance, extensive hyperparameter tuning was performed, including adjustments to learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs.

A comparative study was conducted to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model. The results underline the effectiveness of transfer learning in biometric recognition tasks, with deep architectures providing robust feature representations. Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced overall accuracy and model generalization.

This work demonstrates the potential of advanced CNN architectures in ear biometrics and provides insights into model selection and optimization strategies for biometric systems. Future work will focus on real-time deployment and expanding dataset diversity.

### for now, the zip file is locked due to privacy matter of model. I would be unlocking it or updating the password soon after the conference paper is published.
